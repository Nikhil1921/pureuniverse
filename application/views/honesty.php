                        Every one of us must have heard the phrase “Honesty is the Best Policy”.It is indeed a wise phrase. Probably, every child learns this teaching from their parents. This beautiful teaching has been taught since time immemorial. However, its practice has certainly fallen short. People resort to lies very easily nowadays. Furthermore, there is rampant corruption these days. People deceive others by being dishonest. Hence, there is an urgent need for this teaching’s revival.

                        A major component for developing moral character is Honesty. Honesty helps in developing good attributes like kindness, discipline, truthfulness, moral integrity and more. Lying, cheating, lack of trust, steal, greed and other immoral attributes have no part in Honesty. Honest people are sincere, trustworthy and loyal, throughout their life. Honesty is valuable and it is the habit of utmost importance. There are famous quotes, said by a great personality like “Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom”. It holds good due to its ability to build, shape and motivate integral values in one’s life. Even the personal life and the relationships are depleting and the cases of divorce are increasing, because of the lack of honesty between the couples.

                            Honesty is not just about telling the truth. With the quality of being honest since childhood, the chances of one’s being successful in life are very high. It leads to progress of the individual, family and society as a whole.Saying the truth enables all of us to identify the issue and work as a team to better it. It is a pity that the monster called selfishness is swallowing up honesty as a result of which personal values are declining which causes a lot of dissatisfaction, frustration and cowardice around us.
