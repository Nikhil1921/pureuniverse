                            Experts interpret self-respect as a positive feeling or action expressed towards something. Furthermore, it could also refer to something held in high esteem or regard. Showing Respect is a sign of ethical behaviour. Unfortunately, in the contemporary era, there has been undermining of the value of Respect.

                            Self-respect is fundamental for a great life. If self-respect is lacking this may cause insecurity and the strive to be someone we are not. To develop self-respect means to cultivate the self-confidence to deal with whatever life throws at us. Self-respect comes from an inner belief and not an egoistic feeling of superiority.To maintain a sense of self-respect we need to learn how to deal with criticism and not take it personally, but to look at it from a detached perspective. Maybe it is false, in which case we should ignore it. If there is some truth, we should embrace it.

                                Most noteworthy, there are two essential aspects of Respect. These aspects are self-respect and respect for others.If we have no respect for others, how can we have self-respect? Self-respect means we have inner confidence and inner assurance; this is not a confidence or assurance built on superiority. It is the wrong approach to try and feel better by putting others down. If we look for the good qualities in other people it is easier to remember the good qualities in ourselves.

                                There is great social pressure from parents, work and society to become a certain person and to achieve certain things – this pressure is hard to detach from. Self-respect comes from being true to our inner calling, to have faith in our own values and remember what is important to us. Everyone needs to follow their own path, even if others don’t respect our decision it is important that we do.A healthy level of self-respect enables you to have the confidence to set firm and right boundaries. It means knowing what you stand for and what your values are, and being accepting of both your strengths and weaknesses. The birthplace of the biggest war in the family and in the world is the birth of selfishness, ego and pride. Many successful people like Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs etc. have respected their own decisions and have changed their outlook to self-esteem positively.
