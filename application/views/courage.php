                        “An act of bravery or to do a challenging task without being afraid “orto overcome our fear is courage. Now, when we speak of doing a challenging or a difficult task that does not mean to go and act rashly or do some unlawful thing.A courageous act can be a small act also which is done when a person overcomes his fear and then goes and performs the act. It can be anything, for example, a small girl who loves dancing but is afraid of the stage where she must perform. When she overcomes her fear and becomes brave enough to perform her dance, it is called a courageous act.

                        Courage is not a feeling neither is it an emotion, it is a trigger which when triggered with enough force can make wonders and bring in a change in his life as well as in the society to live the better and face the bitter aspects of life. Courage is an ethical value if it is applied in a moral way. What does that mean? It means to distinguish right from wrong; good from bad and act out of the conviction that morality is the basis of an ethical society.

                        <p>If a child is being bullied or see other being bullied at School/ college or outside, it takes courage to take a stand & support the person being bullied and make the complaint with the right authority so that other don’t face a similar situation or the bully does not dare to repeat the same. Workplaces can provide many challenges that test our ability and willingness to act with courage. If you see someone do something wrong – i.e., steal from the employer; take credit for someone else’s work; falsify data and records, it takes a person of courage to inform the management in the organization about the misdeeds. Doing what is right is not always easy but it is moral behaviour. </p>

                        <p>"Stand up for what is right even if you stand alone" is a very powerful motto for any individual who wants to become more confident and courageous in daily life.</p>
