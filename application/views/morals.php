                        The word ethics is derived from an ancient Greek word ethos which means habit, custom or character. That is morality in the real sense. In other words, a person’s moral values define his character. We are all told what is good and what is bad based on moral norms set by society.Ethics and morality are usually stated in relation to values, as they are the moral and social ideology and application of one’s values.

                            However, those whose economic values are not right are likely to choose a rogue path and become a swindler. It is extremely foolish to have any kind of partnership with someone whose business values are not clear.The group of individuals whose personal value is high can never be low and miserable. Less personal and social value within the family members is the main reason why the courts of India are littered with mutual family allegations.
